## Introduction

The **Social Network Ad Prediction** project demonstrates the application of machine learning to classify user behavior based on demographic and salary data. The aim is to enable businesses to understand user interactions and optimize advertising campaigns.

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of raw data for modeling.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM.
- Comparison of model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- Visualization of key insights from data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning models.
